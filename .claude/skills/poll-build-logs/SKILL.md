# Poll Build Logs

## Instructions

After pushing code changes, use this process to monitor for CI build results and analyze them when available.

**IMPORTANT — Do not wait for a build that won't come:** Before entering the polling loop, check whether there are recent unpushed or just-pushed changes on the session branch that would have triggered a new CI run. If there are NO recent changes (e.g., the branch hasn't been pushed to since the last known build), skip the polling loop entirely — just find the most recent matching build-log branch (Step 2) and report its result. Only enter the polling loop (Step 3) when you have evidence that a new build should be in progress (e.g., you just pushed, or the user just pushed, and no matching build-log exists yet for the current HEAD commit).

### Step 1: Identify the Branch and Commit

Note the current branch name and HEAD commit SHA for matching later:

```bash
git branch --show-current
git rev-parse HEAD
```

Record both values — `BRANCH` and `HEAD_SHA`. The branch is used for initial matching, and the commit SHA is used to verify the build covers the current code (not a stale push).

### Step 2: Snapshot Existing Branches and Check for Existing Match

Record the current build-log branches:

```bash
git ls-remote --heads origin 'refs/heads/build-logs/*'
```

Note the highest run number (e.g., `build-logs/150-...`).

**Before polling, check if the most recent build-log branch already matches the current branch and commit.** Fetch the branch with the highest run number and verify it matches using the process described in Step 4 (branch name AND commit SHA). If it matches, **skip polling entirely** and proceed directly to reporting the result.

This handles the common case where CI has already completed before polling starts — for example, when resuming a session where a previous push already triggered and completed a build.

### Step 3: Wait and Check Periodically

iOS CI builds typically take **15-30 minutes**, but builds with early errors can fail in under 5 minutes. Use a repeating check pattern with **60-second intervals for 45 cycles** (~45 minutes total):

1. **Launch ONE background task** to sleep and then check:
   ```bash
   sleep 60 && git ls-remote --heads origin 'refs/heads/build-logs/*'
   ```
   Run this with `run_in_background: true`.

2. **STOP and WAIT for the `task-notification`** that signals the background task completed. Do NOT read the output file, do NOT launch another cycle, and do NOT send any message to the user until you receive the `task-notification` for this specific task ID. The sleep takes 60 seconds — you must wait the full duration.

3. **Only after receiving the `task-notification`**, read the output file and check for new branches (run numbers higher than the snapshot).

4. If no new branches yet, **go back to step 1** — launch another single background sleep+check.

5. If new branches appeared, proceed to Step 4.

6. **Give up after 45 cycles** (~45 minutes of checking). You MUST run all 45 cycles before giving up — do NOT stop early.

**CRITICAL — One task at a time:** Launch exactly ONE background task per cycle. After launching it, you MUST wait for its `task-notification` before doing anything else related to polling. Do NOT:
- Read the output file immediately after launching (it will be empty — the task is still sleeping)
- Launch multiple background tasks in rapid succession
- Try to "check" on the task before it completes

**CRITICAL — Run all 45 cycles:** You MUST keep polling for the full 45 cycles before giving up. Track your cycle count (e.g., "Poll cycle 7/45"). Do NOT give up early because "no changes were detected" — CI builds take 15-30 minutes, so it is normal to see no new branches for many cycles.

**Why 60-second intervals:** The Claude Code web platform requires background tasks to complete within 90 seconds. A 60-second sleep+check completes well within this limit while providing frequent updates.

**Silence between polls:** Do NOT send a message to the user for each intermediate check. Only notify the user when a matching build result is found or when giving up after timeout. Between polls, continue working on other tasks if available, or remain silent.

**No duplicate polling:** Do NOT invoke this skill if polling is already in progress. Before starting, check whether there are active background poll tasks from a previous invocation. Only one polling loop should be active at a time.

### Step 4: Fetch and Analyze the Build Log

When a build-log branch is found (either pre-existing from Step 2 or newly appeared during polling):

```bash
git fetch origin build-logs/<branch>
git show origin/build-logs/<branch>:build-summary.md
```

**Verify it matches** using two checks:

1. **Branch match**: Check the `Branch` or `PR` field in build-summary.md matches the current branch name.
2. **Commit match**: Extract the `head_sha` from `jobs.json` to verify the build was triggered by the current HEAD commit:
   ```bash
   git show origin/build-logs/<branch>:jobs.json | python3 -c "import sys,json; print(json.load(sys.stdin)['jobs'][0]['head_sha'])"
   ```
   Compare this value against `HEAD_SHA` recorded in Step 1. The `head_sha` in `jobs.json` is the actual branch HEAD commit (not the merge commit shown in build-summary.md), so it can be compared directly with `git rev-parse HEAD`.

**Both checks must pass.** If the branch matches but the commit does not, the build is stale (from a previous push) — ignore it and continue polling for a newer build.

**If multiple new branches appeared** since your last check, pick the one with the highest run number that matches both branch and commit.

**If the new branch does not match** your branch or commit, ignore it and continue polling — another PR's build or a stale build should not terminate your poll loop.

#### On success (pass)

Report to the user that the build passed.

#### On failure (fail)

1. Fetch the full test log:
   ```bash
   git show origin/build-logs/<new-branch>:test.log | grep '✖︎\|error:'
   ```

2. Analyze the failures and determine if they are related to the session's changes.

3. If failures are related, fix them, commit, push, and restart polling from Step 1.

### Step 5: Report to User

Provide a clear summary:
- **Pass**: "CI build passed for commit `<sha>` on branch `<branch>`."
- **Fail**: Include the specific errors/test failures and whether they relate to session changes.
- **Timeout**: Explain that CI hasn't completed yet and suggest next steps.

## Example Flow

### Happy path

```
User: Push my changes and let me know if the build passes.

Claude:
1. Commits and pushes to the PR branch
2. Records: BRANCH=claude/my-feature, HEAD_SHA=abc1234, latest run=150
3. Checks run 150 — branch doesn't match, proceeds to polling
4. Launches ONE background task: sleep 60 && git ls-remote ...
5. STOPS and WAITS — does nothing until task-notification arrives
6. [1 min later] Receives task-notification (cycle 1/45), reads output — no new branches
7. Launches another ONE background task, WAITS again
8. [repeats silently for many cycles — this is normal]
9. [~20 min later, cycle 20/45] Receives task-notification — new branch: build-logs/151-...-pass!
10. Fetches build-summary.md — Branch matches. Checks jobs.json head_sha — matches abc1234.
11. Reports: "CI build passed for commit abc1234 on branch claude/my-feature."
```

### Non-matching branch (another PR's build)

```
Claude:
1. Polling for BRANCH=claude/my-feature, latest run=150
2. [5 min later, cycle 5/45] Receives task-notification — new branch: build-logs/151-...-fail
3. Fetches build-summary.md, sees Branch=claude/other-pr — no match
4. Ignores it, launches next background task, WAITS
5. [18 min later, cycle 18/45] Receives task-notification — new branch: build-logs/152-...-pass
6. Fetches build-summary.md, sees Branch=claude/my-feature — match!
7. Reports result to user
```

### Existing build already matches (resumed session)

```
User: [Resumes session] Poll for build logs.

Claude:
1. Records: BRANCH=claude/my-feature, HEAD_SHA=abc1234
2. Snapshots existing branches — highest is build-logs/177-...-pass
3. Fetches build-summary.md for run 177, sees Branch=claude/my-feature — branch matches
4. Checks jobs.json head_sha for run 177 — abc1234 — commit matches!
5. Skips polling entirely, reports: "CI build already passed for commit abc1234 on branch claude/my-feature (run #177)."
```

### Stale build (new commits pushed after previous build)

```
User: [Resumes session, pushes new commit] Poll for build logs.

Claude:
1. Records: BRANCH=claude/my-feature, HEAD_SHA=def5678
2. Snapshots existing branches — highest is build-logs/177-...-pass
3. Fetches build-summary.md for run 177, sees Branch=claude/my-feature — branch matches
4. Checks jobs.json head_sha for run 177 — abc1234 — does NOT match def5678
5. Build is stale, proceeds to polling loop for a newer build
6. [~20 min later] New branch: build-logs/178-...-pass
7. Verifies branch AND commit match — reports result
```

## Important Notes

- `git ls-remote` only fetches ref names — very lightweight, safe to run frequently.
- Only the 10 most recent build-log branches are retained by CI, so poll promptly after pushing.
- The `Branch` field in build-summary.md is only present for `pull_request` events (not `push` events to dev/main).
