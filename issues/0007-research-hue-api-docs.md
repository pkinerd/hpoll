## Description

Research the Philips Hue API documentation and make it available to Claude for reference during development. This includes:

- Identifying the relevant Hue API endpoints (lights, groups, scenes, schedules, sensors, etc.)
- Documenting authentication and bridge discovery procedures
- Summarizing request/response formats and data models
- Storing the researched documentation on the issues branch (via `docs add`) so Claude can reference it in future sessions
